# Houdini Sound Effects
Houdini works fine for VFX, but the real question is does it work for SFX?

I recently lost my mind and made a bunch of audio effects and a couple of synths in Houdini. Why? No clue!

## How it works
Originally I used brute force. I made a tool to [convert raw sample data to audio](https://mysterypancake.github.io/Fun/html/rawaudio), so you could copy data from Houdini and hear how it sounds.

This was slow and tedious, which took all the fun away from sound design and experimenting.

Luckily I found out CHOPS has audio output, so you can mess around and hear the result without leaving Houdini!
