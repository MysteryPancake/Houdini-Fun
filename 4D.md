# Houdini 4D Shapes
4D and higher dimensional geometry is a really cool topic to research and mess around with.

I wasted a bunch of time looking into it, so I hope I can inspire you to as well!

## What is 4D?
The first step is defining what it means for something to be 4D. Luckily it's pretty simple.

- 3D coordinates can be repesented as a `vector`, meaning 3 floats stored along `(X, Y, Z)` axes.
- 4D coordinates can be represented as a `vector4`, meaning 4 floats stored along `(X, Y, Z, W)` axes.

In other words, we just need to add a `W` axis alongside the `X, Y, Z` axes.

Now we can use 4D coordinates just like 3D coordinates.

```js
vector origin_3d = {0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z)
vector4 origin_4d = {0, 0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z, W)
```

## Working with 4D in Houdini
Unfortunately Houdini is built from the ground-up to deal with 3D geometry.

For example, position `v@P` and velocity `v@N` are hardcoded to work with `vector`, meaning `(X, Y, Z)` coordinates.

There are many ways to get around this. The easiest is adding a float attribute to represent the W axis.

```js
v@P = {0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z)
f@w = 0; // (W)
```

Obviously this isn't much use by itself. It takes a lot of time, effort and development to make use of this.

A great example of this is [Matt Ebb's Slices talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WryM1E8E9qs). He translates, rotates, extrudes and slices 4D shapes just like in 3D.

To represent 4D shapes, Matt used an advanced method involving tetrahedrons, booleans and winding order.

Luckily for idiots like me, there's an easier way. As a bonus, it generalizes to any dimensional space!

## 4D Signed Distance Functions
A simple way to visualise and play with 4D shapes is using 4D SDFs in Houdini.

So what is an SDF? I wrote about them on my [Vexember](./Vexember.md) and [Houdini SDF](./Houdini_SDFs.md) pages.

SDFs are pretty basic. They take a position and return the signed distance to the nearest surface.

Here's a simple SDF, the distance to a 3D sphere at `{0, 0, 0}` with radius 1:

```js
float sdSphere(vector p) {
	return length(p) - 1;
}
```

Let's break it down:

- The input is a 3D position, meaning `(X, Y, Z)`.
- It uses `length()` to get the magnitude, meaning the distance from the position to `{0, 0, 0}`.
- Houdini has `length()` in 3D built-in, which is `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)`.
- Houdini has `length()` in 4D built-in, which is `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z + w*w)`.
- It subtracts 1 from the result, which is a 1D number.

So what stops us from using this in 4D? Let's swap `vector` for `vector4`:

```js
float sdSphere4D(vector4 p) {
	return length(p) - 1;
}
```

And just like that we have a 4D sphere, just as simple as before!

Keep in mind this doesn't work for every SDF, since most are designed for 3D.

For example, here's the SDF of a 3D box ([derived here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62-pRVZuS5c)):

```js
float sdBox(vector p; vector b) {
	vector q = abs(p) - b;
	return length(max(q, 0)) + min(max(q.x, q.y, q.z), 0);
}
```

It's very dependent on each axis, so it needs a small change to include the W axis:

```js
float sdBox4D(vector4 p; vector4 b) {
	vector4 q = abs(p) - b;
	return length(max(q, 0)) + min(max(q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w), 0);
}
```

These changes can be complicated and error-prone, so it helps to learn more about SDFs before trying it yourself.
