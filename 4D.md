# Houdini 4D Geometry
High dimensional geometry is a really cool topic to research and mess around with.

I wasted a bunch of time looking into it, so you have to as well!

## What is 4D?
What does it mean for something to be 4D? Sounds very fancy. Really it's just another axis to store numbers along.

- 3D coordinates can be stored as a `vector`, meaning 3 numbers along `(X, Y, Z)` axes.
- 4D coordinates can be stored as a `vector4`, meaning 4 numbers along `(X, Y, Z, W)` axes.

In other words, we just need to add a `W` axis alongside the `X, Y, Z` axes.

Now we can use 4D coordinates just like 3D coordinates.

```js
vector origin_3d = {0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z)
vector4 origin_4d = {0, 0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z, W)
```

Unfortunately Houdini is built from the ground-up to deal with 3D coordinates.

Position, normals and velocity (`v@P`, `v@N`, `v@v`) are hardcoded to work with vectors, meaning `(X, Y, Z)` coordinates.

There are many ways to get around this. The easiest is adding a float attribute to represent the W axis.

```js
v@P = {0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z)
f@Pw = 0; // (W)
```

Obviously this isn't much use by itself. It takes lots of time, research and development to get anything cool.

A great example is [Matt Ebb's Slices talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WryM1E8E9qs). He translates, rotates, extrudes and slices 4D shapes just like in 3D.
<br>
To represent 4D shapes, he used an advanced method involving tetrahedrons, booleans and winding order correction.

Luckily there's an easier way for idiots like me. Signed distance functions! As a bonus they generalize to any number of dimensions.

## 4D Signed Distance Functions
An easy way to visualise and mess with 4D shapes is using 4D SDFs.

So what is a SDF? I wrote about them on my [Vexember](./Vexember.md) and [Houdini SDF](./Houdini_SDFs.md) pages.
<br>
SDFs are pretty simple. They take a position and return the distance to the nearest surface to it.

<img src="./images/vexember/vexemberd.png" width="400">

Here's an example, the distance to a 3D sphere centered at `{0, 0, 0}` with radius 1:

```js
float sdSphere(vector p) {
	return length(p) - 1.0;
}
```

Let's break it down:

- The input is a 3D position, meaning `(X, Y, Z)`.
- It uses `length()` to get the magnitude, meaning the distance from the position to `{0, 0, 0}`.
- Houdini has `length()` in 3D and 4D built-in, `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)` and `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z + w*w)`.
- It subtracts 1 so the inside of the circle is negative (hence 'signed distance').

So what stops us from using a 4D position instead? Let's swap `vector` for `vector4`:

```js
float sdSphere4D(vector4 p) {
	return length(p) - 1.0;
}
```

In one change, we now have the SDF of a 4D sphere!

Keep in mind it's not this easy for every SDF. For example here's the SDF of a 3D box [derived by Inigo Quilez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62-pRVZuS5c):

```js
float sdBox(vector p; vector bounds) {
	vector q = abs(p) - bounds;
	return length(max(q, 0.0)) + min(max(q.x, q.y, q.z), 0.0);
}
```

This heavily depends on each axis, so for 4D it needs another change to include the W axis:

```js
float sdBox4D(vector4 p; vector4 bounds) {
	vector4 q = abs(p) - bounds;
	return length(max(q, 0.0)) + min(max(q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w), 0.0);
}
```

These changes can be complicated and error-prone, so it helps to learn more about SDFs before trying it yourself.

## 4D slices
Since Houdini and our brains work in 3D space, we can't directly view 4D geometry.
<br>
Instead we have to go with the next best thing, 3D slices! [Check out Matt Ebb's talk on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WryM1E8E9qs) if you haven't already.

If you chop through a 3D shape, you get a 2D slice.

<img src="./images/4d/slice3d.gif" width="600">

Similarly if you chop through a 4D shape, you get a 3D slice.

<img src="./images/4d/slice4d.gif" width="600">

## Rendering a 4D sphere
To render a 3D shape from a 4D SDF, you can [follow the same steps](./Houdini_SDFs.md) as rendering a 3D SDF.

1. Add a VDB node. Set the class to 'Level Set' and the name to `surface`. 'Voxel Size' controls the quality.

<img src="./images/sdfs/vdblevelset.png" width="500">

2. Add a VDB Activate node. Set the size of the VDB to anything above 0.

<img src="./images/sdfs/vdbactivate.png" width="500">

3. Add a Volume Wrangle. Here you define your SDF based on `@P`, for example our 4D sphere:

```js
// 4D sphere SDF
float sdSphere4D(vector4 p; float radius) {
	return length(p) - radius;
}

// W coordinate, this controls the 3D slice we want to render
float w = chf("W");

// Use regular (X, Y, Z) coordinates with our W coordinate to set the slice
vector4 p = set(v@P.x, v@P.y, v@P.z, w);

// Houdini calculates and produces a 3D sphere from the SDF
f@surface = sdSphere4D(p, 1.0);
```

4. Add a VDB Convert node set to 'Polygons' to convert it from a volume into geometry.

<img src="./images/sdfs/vdbconvert.png" width="500">

Try messing with the W slider to see what happens. That slider is cutting a 3D slice from our 4D sphere!

## Rendering a 4D cube
The sphere is pretty boring since it's a sphere from all perspectives, so let's try our cube instead.

```js
float sdBox4D(vector4 p; vector4 bounds) {
        vector4 q = abs(p) - bounds;
        return length(max(q, 0.0)) + min(max(q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w), 0.0);
}

// W coordinate, this controls the 3D slice we want to render
float w = chf("W");

// Use regular (X, Y, Z) coordinates with our W coordinate to set the slice
vector4 p = set(v@P.x, v@P.y, v@P.z, w);

// Houdini calculates and produces a 3D box from the SDF
f@surface = sdBox4D(p, {0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7});
```

If you run this using the same setup from before, you'll see a mushy looking shape.

<img src="./images/4d/crappycube.png" width="300">

This means your Voxel Size is too large on the VDB node. Use a smaller number like 0.01 to get nice pointy edges.

<img src="./images/4d/voxelsize.png" width="600">

Now let's mess with the W slider to see if we can find an interesting slice.

Sadly it's still pretty boring, the cube just flickers in and out.

<img src="./images/4d/cubeslice.gif" width="300">

To get something more interesting, let's transform the cube in 4D. First we need to define common transformations.

## 4D transformations

### Translation
Translation in 4D works the same as in 3D. You just need to add or subtract a `vector4` from the position:

```js
vector4 p = set(v@P.x, v@P.y, v@P.z, w);

// Translate the cube 2 units to the right on the X axis
p -= {2, 0, 0, 0};
```

I subtracted 2 units since SDF translations are reversed, because you translate the world instead of the object.

In other words, I moved the world backwards instead of moving the object forwards.

### Scale
Scale is also the same as in 3D, but it's a bit weird when working with SDFs.

Here's the formula for uniform scale [I stole from Inigo](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/):

```js
sdf(p / scale) * scale;
```

In other words, scale down, sample the SDF, then scale up again:

```js
// Make the sphere 2 times larger
float scale = 2;

// Scale down
float sphereDist = sdSphere(p / scale, 1.0);

// Scale up
f@surface = sphereDist * scale;
```

This scaling is required so space isn't bent out of shape, like the weird distortion from black holes. It has to be Euclidean.

If you try a non-uniform scale it'll screw up the straightness of the SDF, which can cause rendering artifacts.
<br>
OpenVDB tries to make SDFs Euclidean so you might get away with it in Houdini, but you won't get away with it on [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

### Rotation
Rotation is complicated as usual. You have to multiply the position by a rotation matrix, for example:

```js
vector4 p = set(v@P.x, v@P.y, v@P.z, w);

// Rotate around the YW plane over time (angle units are radians)
p *= rotateYW(f@Time);
```

Here's a bunch of 4D rotation matrices I stole from [a Microsoft article by Steven Hollasch](https://web.archive.org/web/20040213224251/http://research.microsoft.com/~hollasch/thesis/chapter2.html). Multiply the position by any of these:

```js
matrix rotateXY(float theta) {
	float c = cos(theta);
	float s = sin(theta);
	return set(
		set(c, s, 0, 0),
		set(-s, c, 0, 0),
		set(0, 0, 1, 0),
		set(0, 0, 0, 1)
	);
}

matrix rotateYZ(float theta) {
	float c = cos(theta);
	float s = sin(theta);
	return set(
		set(1, 0, 0, 0),
		set(0, c, s, 0),
		set(0, -s, c, 0),
		set(0, 0, 0, 1)
	);
}

matrix rotateZX(float theta) {
	float c = cos(theta);
	float s = sin(theta);
	return set(
		set(c, 0, -s, 0),
		set(0, 1, 0, 0),
		set(s, 0, c, 0),
		set(0, 0, 0, 1)
	);
}

matrix rotateXW(float theta) {
	float c = cos(theta);
	float s = sin(theta);
	return set(
		set(c, 0, 0, s),
		set(0, 1, 0, 0),
		set(0, 0, 1, 0),
		set(-s, 0, 0, c)
	);
}

matrix rotateYW(float theta) {
	float c = cos(theta);
	float s = sin(theta);
	return set(
		set(1, 0, 0, 0),
		set(0, c, 0, -s),
		set(0, 0, 1, 0),
		set(0, s, 0, c)
	);
}

matrix rotateZW(float theta) {
	float c = cos(theta);
	float s = sin(theta);
	return set(
		set(1, 0, 0, 0),
		set(0, 1, 0, 0),
		set(0, 0, c, -s),
		set(0, 0, s, c)
	);
}
```

Sorry for the huge wall of code, I promise the next section is something interesting.

## Something interesting
Now onto rotating our 4D cube.

Take the 4D box SDF and the rotation matrices and paste them at the top of the VEX script.

Now let's rotate the cube over time. Pick a couple of matrices and combine them with multiplication.

```js
// W coordinate, this controls the 3D slice we want to render
float w = chf("W");

// Use regular (X, Y, Z) coordinates with our W coordinate to set the slice
vector4 p = set(v@P.x, v@P.y, v@P.z, w);

// Rotate the coordinate space so the shape gets rotated too
p *= rotateZX(f@Time) * rotateZW(f@Time) * rotateYW(f@Time);

// Houdini calculates and produces a 3D box from the SDF
f@surface = sdBox4D(p, {0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7});
```

## 4D normals
Now let's think about normals in 4D. For 3D shapes you'd use a Normal node, but this gives a 3D normal.
<br>
What if we need a true 4D normal representing a true 4D surface? The normal must be 4D too.

We have two options to find the normals of SDFs: smart and brute force.

### Smart: Analytical normals
Just like we calculated the distance directly, we can calculate the normals directly. [Inigo has plenty of examples](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distgradfunctions2d/).
<br>
Directly calculating means we get perfect normals with great performance, since we only sample the SDF once.

However, we need to generalize all the gradient functions to 4D. I'm lazy so I went with the second option.

### Brute force: Numerical normals
Remember how a SDF gets the distance to the nearest surface? This distance grows and shrinks depending how close we are.
<br>
The change in distance tells us the direction away from the surface, which is the normal of the surface.

To find the change in distance, you can sample the SDF at a few points. You need at least 2 samples per axis, forming a cute little octahedron.

<img src="./images/4d/normalsampling.png" width="300">

Next you can use the central difference to find the gradient, just like the Trail node in Houdini.

```js
// Use a small distance between samples for best accuracy
float eps = 0.0001;
vector offset = set(eps, 0, 0, 0);

// Sample two points along the X axis
float sampleA = sdf(p + offset);
float sampleB = sdf(p - offset);

// Central difference, like the Trail node
float dx = (sampleA - sampleB) / (eps * 2);
```

Repeating this for all 4 axes, you get a 4D version of the [SDF normal function](https://iquilezles.org/articles/normalsSDF/).

```js
vector4 calcNormal(vector4 p) {
	float eps = 0.0001;
	vector4 dx = set(eps, 0, 0, 0);
	vector4 dy = set(0, eps, 0, 0);
	vector4 dz = set(0, 0, eps, 0);
	vector4 dw = set(0, 0, 0, eps);
	return normalize(set(
		sdf(p+dx)-sdf(p-dx),
		sdf(p+dy)-sdf(p-dy),
		sdf(p+dz)-sdf(p-dz),
		sdf(p+dw)-sdf(p-dw)
	));
}
```

This is much slower than analytical normals since it samples the SDF 8 times instead of just once.
<br>
I'm sure it could be done with less samples using the [tetrahedron technique](https://iquilezles.org/articles/normalsSDF/), but I haven't looked into it.

## Snapping to 4D surfaces
There's many ways to snap to 3D surfaces in Houdini, like a Ray node set to 'Minimum Distance' or `v@P = minpos(1, v@P)`.
<br>
So how do you do it in 4D? Luckily it's just as easy, we just need the normal and distance.

The normal tells us the direction to travel, and the SDF how far. Combine them and we hit the surface.

```js
vector4 p = set(v@P.x, v@P.y, v@P.z, w);

// Find the direction and distance to the nearest surface
float dist = sdf(p);
vector4 normal = calcNormal(p);

// Move in that direction by the distance, snaps to the surface
p -= dist * normal;
```

## 4D scatter
A simple way to scatter points on a 4D surface is generate points randomly, then snap them to the surface.

This can be done with Point Replicate or Points from Volume, but I did it manually below.

### 1. Generate random 4D points
For better performance, we can generate points in parallel using a Numbers wrangle.

```js
// Generate a random 4D position between {0, 0, 0, 0} and {1, 1, 1, 1}
vector4 randPos = rand(i@elemnum);

// Optionally adjust it to a new bounding box
vector4 fitPos = fit01(randPos, chp("bounds_min"), chp("bounds_max"));

// Add a point with the (X, Y, Z) coordinates
int id = addpoint(0, vector(fitPos));

// Add the (W) coordinate as a point attribute
setpointattrib(0, "Pw", id, fitPos.w);
```

<img src="./images/4d/4dpointbox.png" height="400">

### 2. Snap them to a 4D surface
TODO

## 4D boolean (union, subtraction, intersection, xor)
4D shapes can be combined using standard SDF operations [at the bottom of Inigo's page](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/).

SDF boolean has great performance compared to polygonal boolean, so don't be afraid to use it!

```js
float sphereDist = sdSphere4D(p, 1.0);
float boxDist = sdBox4D(p, {0.5, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7});

// Union: Merges shapes together
f@surface = min(sphereDist, boxDist);

// Subtraction: Removes one shape from the other ('SDF Difference' in OpenVDB)
f@surface = max(-sphereDist, boxDist)

// Intersection: Isolates overlapping regions of both shapes
f@surface = max(sphereDist, boxDist);

// Xor: Isolates regions where the sign mismatches (e.g. positive and negative)
f@surface = max(min(sphereDist, boxDist), -max(sphereDist, boxDist));
```

Keep in mind most of these screw up either the interior or exterior distance.
<br>
As mentioned OpenVDB tries to fix this. If it fails, just use VDB Combine in 3D.

## Storing dead bodies on the W axis
Since the W axis is pretty hard to explore, it's a great place to store your deepest darkest secrets.
<br>
Let's use it to frankenstein two 3D SDFs into one horribly broken 4D SDF!

First take any 2 bits of geometry and use VDB from Polygons to convert them into distance VDBs. I chose the pig and tommy.

<img src="./images/4d/vdbfrankenstein.png" width="600">

Now let's mangle them into 4D space by sampling their distances along random axes.

```js
// Set W to the Z axis, just in case things weren't broken enough already
vector4 pos = set(v@P.x, v@P.y, v@P.z, v@P.z);

// Rotate around to see the horrors
pos *= rotateZW(ch("Z")) * rotateYW(ch("Y")) * rotateXW(ch("X"));

// Sample (X, Y, Z) for the pig's distance
float pigDist = volumesample(1, "surface", set(pos.x, pos.y, pos.z));

// Sample (X, Y, W) for tommy's distance
float tommyDist = volumesample(2, "surface", set(pos.x, pos.y, pos.w));

// SDF union to combine the distances into one horrible non-euclidean distance
f@surface = min(pigDist, tommyDist);
```

By rotating the shape in 4D, we can observe the horrors as tommy and the pig try to escape their reality.
