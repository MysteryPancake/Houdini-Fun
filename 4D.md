# Houdini 4D Geometry
4D and higher dimensional geometry is a really cool topic to research and mess around with.

I wasted a bunch of time looking into it, so I hope you do as well!

## What is 4D?
The first step is defining what it means for something to be 4D. Luckily it's pretty simple.

- 3D coordinates can be stored as a `vector`, meaning 3 numbers along `(X, Y, Z)` axes.
- 4D coordinates can be stored as a `vector4`, meaning 4 numbers along `(X, Y, Z, W)` axes.

In other words, we just need to add a `W` axis alongside the `X, Y, Z` axes.

Now we can use 4D coordinates just like 3D coordinates.

```js
vector origin_3d = {0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z)
vector4 origin_4d = {0, 0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z, W)
```

## Working with 4D in Houdini
Unfortunately Houdini is built from the ground-up to deal with 3D geometry.

For example, position `v@P` and velocity `v@N` are hardcoded to work with vectors, meaning `(X, Y, Z)` coordinates.

There are many ways to get around this. The easiest is adding a float attribute to represent the W axis.

```js
v@P = {0, 0, 0}; // (X, Y, Z)
f@w = 0; // (W)
```

Obviously this isn't much use by itself. It takes lots of time, research and development to get anything cool.

A great example is [Matt Ebb's Slices talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WryM1E8E9qs). He translates, rotates, extrudes and slices 4D shapes just like in 3D.

To represent 4D shapes, he used an advanced method involving tetrahedrons, booleans and winding order correction.

Luckily for idiots like me, there's an easier way. Signed distance functions! As a bonus, it generalizes to any dimension you want.

## 4D Signed Distance Functions
An easy way to visualise and mess with 4D shapes is using 4D SDFs.

So what is an SDF? I wrote about them on my [Vexember](./Vexember.md) and [Houdini SDF](./Houdini_SDFs.md) pages.

SDFs are pretty simple. They take a position and return the signed distance to the nearest surface.

Here's an example, the distance to a 3D sphere centered at `{0, 0, 0}` with radius 1:

```js
float sdSphere(vector p) {
	return length(p) - 1;
}
```

Let's break it down:

- The input is a 3D position, meaning `(X, Y, Z)`.
- It uses `length()` to get the magnitude, meaning the distance from the position to `{0, 0, 0}`.
- Houdini has `length()` in 3D built-in, which is `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)`.
- Houdini has `length()` in 4D built-in, which is `sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z + w*w)`.
- It subtracts 1 from the result, which is a 1D number.

So what stops us from using a 4D position instead? Let's swap `vector` for `vector4`:

```js
float sdSphere4D(vector4 p) {
	return length(p) - 1;
}
```

And just like that we have the SDF of a 4D sphere!

Keep in mind this doesn't work as nicely for every SDF, since most are designed for 3D positions.

For example, here's the SDF of a 3D box ([derived here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62-pRVZuS5c)):

```js
float sdBox(vector p; vector b) {
	vector q = abs(p) - b;
	return length(max(q, 0)) + min(max(q.x, q.y, q.z), 0);
}
```

It depends heavily on each axis, so it needs a small change to include the W axis:

```js
float sdBox4D(vector4 p; vector4 b) {
	vector4 q = abs(p) - b;
	return length(max(q, 0)) + min(max(q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w), 0);
}
```

These changes can be complicated and error-prone, so it helps to learn more about SDFs before trying it yourself.
